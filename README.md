Life is too short to find jobs manually

## Find jobs
Monitor platforms like Smart Recruiters and Workday for jobs based on keywords you like (other platforms to be added soon)

### Get Notified!
Whenever a job matches your requirements, you will get a notification (supports Windows for now). 
Click on the notification to open the matched jobs on your browser.

## Apply for jobs automatically
Save your application within code and conveniently apply to jobs you like (supports Smart Recruiters for now)

## Generate customized cover letters 
Add your cover letter and tailor it according for the jobs you are applying to.
Currently it can customize the cover letter and copy it to your clipboard. 

Will support Canva soon.
